# Gerenal Idea
Today's idea is as follows:
* Geo-Position Features: A map which shows all small businesses which have partnership with **AMEX**
* Subscription & Award Points Features:feature implemented within the **AMEX mobile app** that shows the 
customer their current subscriptions with American Express's partnerships - better manage their account and improve
the digital customer experience since a pain point is solved (all subscription bills are displayed
in the same place and that makes things more organised).
This should be linked to **AMEX membership reward program** - the current situation is that customers
earn points when they use the AMEX credit card and can redeem those points to purchase AMEX partner products.
One potential idea is to link the subscription feature to the membership reward program: points can be redeemed 
to continue subscriptions (other purchases such as drinks, coffes, meals will be still available).
This is to increase revenue and exposure of the prime services that our partners offer.
* Recommendation Feature:  Based on purchasing history and places where they spent/redeemed their points from Amex Membership Rewards, customize preferences to recommend local restaurants/businesses with good rating. Then, both Amex and small businesses benefit:
   - Small businesses: get extra profit as more Amex clients spend money on these businesses + gain visibility 
   - Amex: more users make purchases with Amex 
   
We could implement PUSH-UP notifications. Based on
  - Customer purchase history and preferences
  AND
  - Total points that can be redeemed at the moment
Top choices and options (ie., in a ranking) could be suggested to the customer. Data ins constantly received and ML models are
constantly updated.

## New Idea 1
* New Amex Membership 'Green' programme: partner with shops/businesses that promote sustainable development/healthy lifestyle/environmentally friendly products
   - Get extra points whenever purchased from these shops
* Savings made easier: round up transactions and automatically transfer spare change into savings or as reward points
* Combine savings idea with small business partnerships idea: get recommendations of small shops/restaurants according to customized preferences and whenever the user spends on these small businesses, collect spare change from the bill as reward points, and the more points collected from repeated transactions in these shops, the user gets more rewards (discounts, free samples...), so that the user has incentives to spend again in these shops.

## New Idea 2
Problem statement :  Physical store contains limited information about customers preferences, either because the conversation with them are too short, or the customers are new, struggling to convert them to long term customers.

3 bullets points to highlight current painpoints:
- Data is too parochial as each store/brand only have records of customer purchases from their own stores.
- Customers only knows what they currently want, which made the stores unable to sell more products to them.
- Conversations with customers are very passive (in usual scenario, customers takes initiative to ask what they want, and shopkeepers responses from the question), hence limited customer experience.

3 bullets points to highlight our solution :
Our solution is a platform where shopkeepers can track customers' past purchases history from every retailer to :
- Gain more profit by selling more products to customers before they know they want it.
- Gain more customer expereinces by taking initiative to introduce products that align with customers' preferences.
- Make better business decision by knowing customers' purchases from competitors. (*There might be a way to make this autonomous, Yang Tao might have an idea)

3 bullets points to highlight our features :
- A camera to recognise whether visiting customers are customers from Amex.
- Query the customers spending records and extract only relevant information. (Sport shops only able to receive sports related purchases).
- Display the information on the platform accessible by the retailer (website/app).

Example Scenario : 

Customer X is a long term customer of Adidas and visited Nike for the first time, just to replace his old socks. In a normal scenario, he will find the socks by himself or ask a shopkeeper, buy the socks and leave. X is not visiting Nike to buy more products.

If Nike is utilising our product, the shopkeeper knows about X's past purchase history in Adidas and other sport shops. For example, X used to buy Real Madrid jersey and running shoes in Adidas. The shopkeeper can initiate a new conversation with X, asking him : "Do you like football?". The shopkeeper can proceed to lavish compliments on Real Madrid (flattery xD), show him football boots and protective knee pads, and even better, boots that Real Madrid players usually wear. X initially never think of buying boots, but he might think it's a great opportunity to buy one. But if he is concerned about the price, the shopkeeper can ask for his contact email, and inform him whenever there is a discount for the boots. Either outcomes will provide a delightful shopping experience to X, allowing X to spend more on the shop and be a long-term customer.

Nike could also use customers' records to deduce the customers' supporting teams in that area. For example, most visiting customers bought Real Madrid and Manchester United jerseys in Adidas. Nike can deduce that the football fans in that area are less likely to be fans of teams with Nike jerseys (eg. Chelsea or Barcelona), so they can reduce the stocks of these jerseys for that shop in the future to prevent further losses and avoid profligation.
