The documention of American Express Challenge README

## Gerenal Idea
Today's idea is as follows:
* Geo-Position Features: A map which shows all small businesses which have partnership with **AMEX**
* Subscription & Award Points Features:
* Recommendation Feature:  Based on purchasing history and places where they spent/redeemed their points from Amex Membership Rewards, customize preferences to recommend local restaurants/businesses with good rating. Then, both Amex and small businesses benefit:
   - Small businesses: get extra profit as more Amex clients spend money on these businesses + gain visibility 
   - Amex: more users make purchases with Amex
