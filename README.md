The documention of American Express Challenge README

## Gerenal Idea
Today's idea is as follows:
* Geo-Position Features: A map which shows all small businesses which have partnership with **AMEX**
* Subscription & Award Points Features:
* Recommendation Feature:  Based on purchasing history and places where they spent/redeemed their points from Amex Membership Rewards, customize preferences to recommend local restaurants/businesses with good rating. Then, both Amex and small businesses benefit:
   - Small businesses: get extra profit as more Amex clients spend money on these businesses + gain visibility 
   - Amex: more users make purchases with Amex 

## New Ideas
* New Amex Membership 'Green' programme: partner with shops/businesses that promote sustainable development/healthy lifestyle/environmentally friendly products
   - Get extra points whenever purchased from these shops
* Savings made easier: round up transactions and automatically transfer spare change into savings or as reward points
* Combine savings idea with small business partnerships idea: get recommendations of small shops/restaurants according to customized preferences and whenever the user spends on these small businesses, collect spare change from the bill as reward points, and the more points collected from repeated transactions in these shops, the user gets more rewards (discounts, free samples...), so that the user has incentives to spend again in these shops.
