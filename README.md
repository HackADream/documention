The documention of American Express Challenge README

## Gerenal Idea
Today's idea is as follows:
* Geo-Position Features: A map which shows all small businesses which have partnership with **AMEX**
* Subscription & Award Points Features:
* Recommendation Feature:  Based on purchasing history and places where they spent/redeemed their points from Amex Membership Rewards, customize preferences to recommend local restaurants/businesses with good rating. Then, both Amex and small businesses benefit:
   - Small businesses: get extra profit as more Amex clients spend money on these businesses + gain visibility 
   - Amex: more users make purchases with Amex 

## New Ideas
* New Amex Membership 'Green' programme: partner with shops/businesses that promote sustainable development/healthy lifestyle/environmentally friendly products
   - Get extra points whenever purchased from these shops
* Savings made easier: round up transactions and automatically transfer spare change into savings or as reward points
* Combine savings idea with small business partnerships idea: get recommendations of small shops/restaurants according to customized preferences and whenever the user spends on these small businesses, collect spare change from the bill as reward points, and the more points collected from repeated transactions in these shops, the user gets more rewards (discounts, free samples...), so that the user has incentives to spend again in these shops.

## Feedback

Currently, we have 3 separate feature that potentially can be integrated together. However, there is no mention about specific problem that each feature want to solve. This could make us wonder why do we want these features at the first place.

For example, as a consumer, I don’t know why I want a website that shows all small business which have partnership with AMEX. I would rather use Google maps that show more options than AMEX. If it is meant to be integrated with the second idea that, we want a website that can show awards points that can be made in Amex partnered shops, and these shops are displayed on a map. I’d also prefer to use a more readily sites like Amex’s official website to search Membership Rewards, then use Google Maps to go to the location. The features on the top are neither could replace existing technologies, or help a problem that still have no solution find a breakthrough.

Since we’ve decided to do the second theme, so I have thought some problem statements that might have potential to find breakthrough. From the problems, we could plan to use the existing ideas, or new idea to solve it. The idea here is not to create or combine multiple ideas that already have corresponding solution. The ideas we need to come up first are not features of the app, (we’ll put MoSCoW aside first), but the high level solutions that our product provide that solve the problem, and features will only come later. We also have to make sure our ideas are painpoints of competitor products, either these products don’t solve the problems or unable to solve it effectively.

The problem statements here are not verified yet, which means they might not be actual problems happening in the real world. Please feel free to comment about the problems, edit or add if you wish to.

## Problem Statement : 

Problem 1 : The Covid-19 has affected the small businesses. People don’t want to spend much money on unnecessary products or go to physical stores.

Problem 2 : We are unable to know the preferences of people who purchase items on physical stores.

Problem 3 : The Covid-19 has made many people change their spending habits due to fall of income, but not being able to balance between spending on necessities or wants.

Problem 4 : Many people want to shift their business model due to the pandemic, but have lack of confident, as there is no analysis on what new changes are likely to succeed.
